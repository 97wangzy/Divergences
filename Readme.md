This branch is the most up to date version of the HPM port of Divergences (HPM-DoD). All major bugs of the port have been fixed, along with preexisting DoD bugs, meaning that DoD-HPM is now more bugfree than the original PDM version it was ported from. The HPM port has been abandoned by the development team in favour of going back to a PDM base for the mod, meaning that whenever that version is released, this branch will become the only place to download DoD-HPM. 

History of the mod:

A mod for Victoria II with Heart of Darkness Expansion that continues the legacy of Divergences : An Alter Vicky mod created by Kinniken. HPM port by capitanloco6.


According to the quantum theory, every decision made in the universe creates an alternative universe where all the following events take a different way. The first decision that diverged the timeline is called the Point of Divergence.

In the Divergences mod there are PODs that are not bound to each other:
- The duke of Burgundy decides to continue his support for Plantagenets in the Hundred Years' War
- The personal union of Denmark, Norway and Sweden survives and evolves to a unitary state
- Isabella of Spain married a Portuguese prince, instead of Ferdinand II.
- The Chenghua Emperor does not stop Ming China's explorations, but decides to pursue them with greater zeal than before
But that were not all the changes. The timeline began to diverge more and more and after 400 years the very world as we know it looks absolutely different...
