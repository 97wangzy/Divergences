RUS_EXP_202201_t;Russian Ambitions In The West$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
RUS_EXP_202201_d;Now that we've united the Russian people, there is some debate about how to handle the various states on our western border. As we see it, there are two major options. First, we could attempt to project sea power by seizing ports and territory along either the Baltic or Black seas, both of which would ease diplomacy and military coordination with the states of Western Europe. Expanding to the north gives us opportunities to weaken our enemies, while a southern strategy would be easier to implement due to the decline of the steppe khanates. Alternatively, we could focus on liberating the Ruthenian people to our west. Since they are so culturally similar to us, it would be easier to incorporate them into our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
