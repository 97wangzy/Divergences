RUS_EXP_202201_t;Russian Ambitions In The West$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
RUS_EXP_202201_d;Now that we've united the Russian people, there is some debate about how to handle the various states on our western border. As we see it, there are two major options. First, we could attempt to project sea power by seizing ports and territory along either the Baltic or Black seas, both of which would ease diplomacy and military coordination with the states of Western Europe. Expanding to the north gives us opportunities to weaken our enemies, while a southern strategy would be easier to implement due to the decline of the steppe khanates. Alternatively, we could focus on liberating the Ruthenian people to our west. Since they are so culturally similar to us, it would be easier to incorporate them into our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

move_capital_to_nyenschantz_desc;In the early 18th century, Mikhail the Great made great efforts to modernize and strengthen Muscovy. We should honor and continue his efforts by building a great city on the Baltic and making it our capital. Nyenschantz isn't ice-free all year, but it's easily defensible and already somewhat populated. Furthermore, it would allow our a greater degree of control over our new Baltic subjects, which could very well make integrating them easier.$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

move_capital_to_rostov_desc;Rostov is located at the mouth of the Don River and has easy access to the Black Sea. If we are to focus on expanding southwards, it would make an excellent capital, giving us easy access to the entire Mediterranean and opening up many opportunities for trade, diplomacy, and expansion. We would also be able to exert greater control over recently incorporated steppe peoples, which could very well make integrating them easier.$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
